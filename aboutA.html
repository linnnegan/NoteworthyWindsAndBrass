        Eli Kronenberg has been repairing instruments professionally since 1988. He began repair training at S.U.N.Y. Potsdam, and went on to work at Giardinelli Band Instruments pro shop. Giardinelli’s was on 46th street in NYC, and was the premier brass shop in the country until they moved to Syracuse in 1991.  Giardinelli’s specialized in high-end brass instrument sales, repairs and custom work.  His responsibilities included brass instrument repairs, custom mouthpiece cutting and sales.

        In the early 1990’s, he trained at the nation’s largest professional flute retailer in repair and restoration.  In 2002, he purchased one of Long Island’s well established woodwind repair shops.

        He is currently the director of bands at a high profile New York City arts magnet high school.  As an educator, he can properly fit the right instrument for you or your child: beginner, intermediate or professional.  For the discerning professional, he can finely tune your instrument to your personal liking, something most music stores cannot offer.  For brass instruments, he offers ultrasonic cleanings.  Top quality services at fair prices and personal attention sets him apart from traditional retail shops.
